# YOLO-World-EfficientSAM
This repository contains notebook for running [YOLO-World](https://github.com/AILab-CVC/YOLO-World) model along with [EfficientSAM](https://github.com/yformer/EfficientSAM).
* YOLOWorld is used for zero-shot object detection using text prompts
* EfficientSAM performs segmentation on bounding boxes that were detected by YOLOWorld

The notebook allows you to define a set of classes and retrive both the bounding boxes and the segmentation masks for each object of interest in an image or in a video.
