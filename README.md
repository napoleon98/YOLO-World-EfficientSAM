# YOLO-World-EfficientSAM
This repository contains code for running the [YOLO-World](https://github.com/AILab-CVC/YOLO-World) model along with [EfficientSAM](https://github.com/yformer/EfficientSAM).
The YOLO model predicts bounding boxes based on text prompts, while the EfficientSAM model takes the detected bounding boxes as input and performs segmentation.
