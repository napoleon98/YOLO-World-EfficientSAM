# YOLO-World-EfficientSAM
This repository contains code for running the [YOLO-World](https://github.com/AILab-CVC/YOLO-World) model along with [EfficientSAM](https://github.com/yformer/EfficientSAM).
* YOLOWorld is used for zero-shot object detection using text prompts
* EfficientSAM performs segmentation on bounding boxes that were detected by YOLOWorld
